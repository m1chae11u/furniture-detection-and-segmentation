# furniture-detection-and-segmentation
My implementation on a furniture object detection and segmentation model using YOLOv8 trained on furniture dataset along with Meta's SAM segmentation masking with auto-annotation functionality.

progress: everything is currently functional using yolov8n.pt. YOLOv8 furniture training still a WIP, will replace yolov8n.pt once model is built.
